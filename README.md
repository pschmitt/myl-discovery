# 📩 myl-discovery

myl-discovery is a Python library designed to detect email settings of a given 
email address or domain.

## 📥 Installation

To install myl-discovery, run the following command:

```bash
pip install myl-discovery
```

## 📖 Usage

After installing the package, you can use the `autodiscover` function to 
discover the email settings for a domain. Here's an example:

```python
from myldiscovery import autodiscover

settings = autodiscover("yourdomain.com")  # or me@yourdomain.com
print(settings)

# For Exchange autodiscovery you need to provide credentials
settings = autodiscover(
    'me@yourdomain.com', 
    username='WORKGROUP\me', 
    password='mypassword1234'
)
```

## 📄 Output

The `autodiscover` function returns a dictionary with the detected settings. 
The dictionary contains two keys, `imap` and `smtp`, each containing a 
dictionary with the keys `server`, `port`, and `starttls`. 

Here's an example:

```json
{
  "imap": {
    "server": "imap.yourdomain.com",
    "port": 993,
    "starttls": false
  },
  "smtp": {
    "server": "smtp.yourdomain.com",
    "port": 587,
    "starttls": true
  }
}
```

## 🧩 Autodiscover Functions

myl-discovery exposes several functions to discover email settings:

- `autodiscover`: This function wraps the below function do automatically detect
the right settings. (See Autodiscover strategy for more information)
- `autodiscover_srv`: This function attempts to resolve SRV records for 
the domain to discover IMAP and SMTP servers.
- `autodiscover_exchange`: This function attempts to use the Exchange 
Autodiscover service to discover email settings. It requires a username and 
password.
- `autodiscover_autoconfig`: This function attempts to fetch and parse an 
autoconfig XML file from a URL specified in the domain's TXT records.
- `autodiscover_port_scan`: This function performs a port scan on the domain 
to discover open IMAP and SMTP ports.

## 🧠 Autodiscover Strategy

The `autodiscover` function uses the following strategy to discover 
email settings:

1. It first attempts to use `autodiscover_autoconfig` to discover settings 
from an autoconfig/autodiscover URL specified in the domain's TXT records.
2. If that fails, it attempts to use `autodiscover_srv` to discover settings 
from the domain's SRV records.
3. If that fails and a password is provided, it attempts to use 
`autodiscover_exchange` to discover settings using the 
Exchange Autodiscover service (only if credentials were provided)
4. If all else fails, it uses `autodiscover_port_scan` to discover settings by 
performing a port scan on the domain.
